#Time series Prediction on Google Trend data using LSTM

###Overview:
This project sought to use LSTM to predict Google Trends data for the keyword -'data science course'. The inspiration for this project is to understand the increasing interest in learning data science and see if we can predict the future trend using LSTM model.

###Data Source:
Data has been collected from Google Trends using [pytrends API](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends)

###Techniques used:
1. Downloading data using pytrends API
2. pandas and numpy for datetime, data preparation 
3. Tensorflow for LSTM modeling
